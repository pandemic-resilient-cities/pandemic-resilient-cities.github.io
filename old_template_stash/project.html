							<h1>Optimizing Cities to Attenuate Pandemic Threats</h1>
							<span class="image main"><!--img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /--></span>
							<p>Cities have been unintentionally optimized to amplify pandemic threats. The social and technological networks that drive economic growth and innovation in cities also promote the transmission and import/export of a wide range of emerging pathogens, including both directly transmitted and vector-borne infections. While pandemic threats spread rapidly through cities, control is inherently delayed by the time required for infectious individuals to access and progress through health systems (McGough et al. 2020). As a result, urban populations have low epidemic thresholds (Delamater et al. 2019): a few infections can commit a city to a massive epidemic surge, and these surges risk initiating a chain reaction in other cities connected by travel, leading rapidly to regional or global spread. The chain reactions that occur after urban networks cross their epidemic tipping points are not reversible in our present paradigm (May 2001, Newman 2002). Rather, countering epidemic momentum after crossing a tipping point currently requires measures that are fundamentally unsustainable (e.g., lockdown). Recently developed mathematical models suggest that feedback loops between predictive intelligence and adaptive response can allow populations to step back across epidemic tipping points (Weitz et al. 2020) if the feedback is sufficiently localized (Funk et al. 2009) and rapid (Martin et al. 2020). Currently lacking is the integration of theory and engineering with public health that would allow such prediction-response systems to be designed, built, and widely adopted. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for multidisciplinary research on prediction-response integrations that allow cities to step back across their epidemic tipping points. Without these city-level ‘immune systems’ pandemic threats will progress from local to global scales with increasing frequency over the next century (Morens and Fauci 2020).</p>
							<p>Our long-term goal is to address the grand challenge of transforming cities from pandemic amplifiers to attenuators, by leveraging the networks of interacting components that characterize urban environments to boost epidemic thresholds of cities, by creating feedback loops between predictive intelligence and adaptive response. Boosting the epidemic thresholds of cities is a grand challenge because doing so is both necessary and sufficient to avert the chain reactions that lead to global pandemics. The objective here is to develop the required multidisciplinary foundation in public health, theory and engineering that will lead to the development of effective and widely adoptable pandemic prediction-response systems in cities. Our rationale is that such systems will make it possible to counter epidemic momentum much earlier during localized emergence, thereby averting the inter-city chain reactions that lead to global spread. Our multidisciplinary team is well-prepared for the proposed work because we have recently developed, in collaboration with public health agencies, county and city officials, successful community- level adaptive monitoring systems for SARS-CoV-2, which integrate the biological, computational, engineering and social axes of pandemic dynamics and which have been extensively testing in a variety of communities.</p>
							<p>We will accomplish our objective through the following specific aims:
								<ol>
									<li>Build and scale community-academic partnerships with public health professionals on pandemic predictive intelligence and adaptive response.</li>
									<li>Develop mathematical and computational models of stepping back across epidemic tipping points</li>
									<li>Prototype city-scale feedback loops that predict, and proactively alter, infectious disease transmission rates.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>The proposed work has the potential to transform the way cities respond to pandemic threats by allowing them to step back across epidemic tipping points. Expected outcomes will form the basis for a competitive phase 2 proposal including: community-academic partnerships (aim 1) ready to develop contagion prediction-response systems and evaluate their effectiveness and adoptability; epidemic theory for prediction-response feedback (aim 2) which will provide a framework for system design; and city-scale prototypes (aim 3), which will allow empirical comparison of design alternatives and identification of unknown risk elements.</p>
